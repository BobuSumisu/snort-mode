* Snort Major Mode for Emacs
** About SNORT®

   [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/Snort_ids_logo.png]]

   [[http://www.snort.org/][Snort]] is an open source network intrusion prevention and detection system (IDS/IPS) 
   developed by [[http://www.sourcefire.com/][Sourcefire]]. 

   Combining the benefits of signature, protocol, and anomaly-based inspection, 
   Snort is the most widely deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide. 

   With millions of downloads and nearly 400,000 registered users, 
   Snort has become the de facto standard for IPS. 

** Emacs 

   [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] is an extensible, customizable text editor—and more. 
   At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the 
   Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing. 

** Features

   Support for syntax highlighting, commenting and indentation.

   Validate the syntax of the current file with =snort-validate= and test it against a 
   PCAP-file with =snort-test-pcap=.

   Jump between rules with =snort-next-rule= and =snort-previous-rule=.

** Customizable variables
   
   Variables are in the =snort= group.

   - =snort-basic-offset=: the indentation level
   - =snort-executable=: path to the Snort executable

** Todo
*** Misc.
    - Remove word lists when regexp are created? (free memory)
    - Does not support user created rule actions 
    - Variable modifiers 
    - Syntax table
*** Functions
    - =snort-kill=: kill rule at point
    - =snort-expand=/=snort-contract=/=snort-expand-all=/=snort-contract-all=: toggle between one-line and multiline rules (one modifier per line)
    - =snort-create-rule=: create skelleton for common rules (e.g. dns query, http-requests, ping)
