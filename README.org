* Snort Major Mode
** Disclaimer
   This is my first project in elisp, so any tips/issues are highly welcome! 
** Features
*** Misc
    Basic support for syntax highlighting, commenting and indentation.
*** Testing
    Validate the syntax of the current rule file with =snort-validate=
    To test rules against a PCAP file =snort-test-pcap=
*** Functions
    Go to the next Snort rule with =snort-next-rule=
    Go to the previous rule =snort-previous-rule=
*** Todo
    - Remove word lists when regexp are created? (free memory) 
    - Does not support user created rule actions 
    - Variable modifiers 
    - Syntax table
    - Function =snort-kill-rule=
