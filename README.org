* Snort Major Mode
** Disclaimer
   This is my first project in elisp, so any tips/issues are highly welcome! 
** What is Snort?
   [[http://www.snort.org/][Snort]] is an open source network intrusion prevention and detection system (IDS/IPS) 
   developed by [[http://www.sourcefire.com/][Sourcefire]]. 

   Combining the benefits of signature, protocol, and anomaly-based inspection, 
   Snort is the most widely deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide. 

   With millions of downloads and nearly 400,000 registered users, 
   Snort has become the de facto standard for IPS. 
** Features
