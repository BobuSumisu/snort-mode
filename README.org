** About SNORT®
   [[http://www.snort.org/][Snort]] is an open source network intrusion prevention and detection system (IDS/IPS) 
   developed by [[http://www.sourcefire.com/][Sourcefire]]. 

   [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/Snort_ids_logo.png]]

   Combining the benefits of signature, protocol, and anomaly-based inspection, 
   Snort is the most widely deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide. 

   With millions of downloads and nearly 400,000 registered users, 
   Snort has become the de facto standard for IPS. 
** Features
   Support for syntax highlighting, commenting and indentation.

   Validate the syntax of the current file with =snort-validate= and test it against a 
   PCAP-file with =snort-test-pcap=.

   Jump between rules with =snort-next-rule= and =snort-previous-rule=.

*** Todo
    - Remove word lists when regexp are created? (free memory) 
    - Does not support user created rule actions 
    - Variable modifiers 
    - Syntax table
    - Function =snort-kill-rule=
